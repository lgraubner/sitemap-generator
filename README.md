> Easily create XML sitemaps for your website.

Generates a sitemap by crawling your site. Uses streams to efficiently write the sitemap to your drive and runs asynchronously to avoid blocking the thread. Is cappable of creating multiple sitemaps if threshold is reached. Respects robots.txt and meta tags.

## Install

This module is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```
$ npm install -S sitemap-generator
```

This module is running only with Node.js and is not meant to be used in the browser.

```JavaScript
const SitemapGenerator = require('sitemap-generator');
```

## Usage
```JavaScript
const SitemapGenerator = require('sitemap-generator');

// create generator
const generator = SitemapGenerator('http://example.com', {
  stripQuerystring: false
});

// register event listeners
generator.on('done', () => {
  // sitemaps created
});

// start the crawler
generator.start();
```

The crawler will fetch all folder URL pages and file types [parsed by Google](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35287?hl=en). If present the `robots.txt` will be taken into account and possible rules are applied for each URL to consider if it should be added to the sitemap. Also the crawler will not fetch URL's from a page if the robots meta tag with the value `nofollow` is present and ignore them completely if `noindex` rule is present. The crawler is able to apply the `base` value to found links.

## API

The generator offers straightforward methods to start and stop it. You can also query some information about status and output.

### getPaths()

Returns array of paths to generated sitemaps. Empty until the crawler is done.

### getStats()

Returns object with info about fetched URL's. Get's updated live during crawling process.

```JavaScript
{
  added: 0,
  ignored: 0,
  errored: 0
}
```

### getStatus()

Returns the status of the generator. Possible values are `waiting`, `started`, `stopped` and `done`.

### start()

Starts crawler asynchronously and writes sitemap to disk.

### stop()

Stops the running crawler and halts the sitemap generation.

### queueURL(url)

Add a URL to crawler's queue. Useful to help crawler fetch pages it can't find itself. 

## Options

You can provide some options to alter the behaviour of the crawler.

```JavaScript
var generator = SitemapGenerator('http://example.com', {
  crawlerMaxDepth: 0,
  filepath: path.join(process.cwd(), 'sitemap.xml'),
  maxEntriesPerFile: 50000,
  stripQuerystring: true
});
```

### crawlerMaxDepth

Type: `number`  
Default: `0`

Defines a maximum distance from the original request at which resources will be fetched.

### filepath

Type: `string`  
Default: `./sitemap.xml`

Filepath for the new sitemap. If multiple sitemaps are created "part_$index" is appended to each filename.

### httpAgent

Type: `HTTPAgent`  
Default: `http.globalAgent`

Controls what HTTP agent to use. This is useful if you want configure HTTP connection through a HTTP/HTTPS proxy (see [http-proxy-agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-proxy-agent)).

### httpsAgent

Type: `HTTPAgent`  
Default: `https.globalAgent`

Controls what HTTPS agent to use. This is useful if you want configure HTTPS connection through a HTTP/HTTPS proxy (see [https-proxy-agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/https-proxy-agent)).

### maxEntriesPerFile

Type: `number`  
Default: `50000`

Google limits the maximum number of URLs in one sitemap to 50000. If this limit is reached the sitemap-generator creates another sitemap. A sitemap index file will be created as well.

### stripQueryString

Type: `boolean`  
Default: `true`

Whether to treat URL's with query strings like `http://www.example.com/?foo=bar` as indiviual sites and add them to the sitemap.

### userAgent

Type: `string`  
Default: `Node/SitemapGenerator`

Set the User Agent used by the crawler.

## Events

The Sitemap Generator emits several events which can be listened to.

### `add`

Triggered when the crawler successfully added a resource to the sitemap. Passes the url as argument.

```JavaScript
generator.on('add', (url) => {
  // log url
});
```

### `done`

Triggered when the crawler finished and the sitemap is created. Provides statistics as first argument. Stats are the same as from `getStats`.

```JavaScript
generator.on('done', (stats) => {
  // sitemaps created
});
```

### `error`

Thrown if there was an error while fetching an URL. Passes an object with the http status code, a message and the url as argument.

```JavaScript
generator.on('error', (error) => {
  console.log(error);
  // => { code: 404, message: 'Not found.', url: 'http://example.com/foo' }
});
```

### `ignore`

If an URL matches a disallow rule in the `robots.txt` file or meta robots noindex is present this event is triggered. The URL will not be added to the sitemap. Passes the ignored url as argument.

```JavaScript
generator.on('ignore', (url) => {
  // log ignored url
});
```
